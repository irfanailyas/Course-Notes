LANGUAGES:-
It is a tools or means of expressing and recording thoughts. Computer has its own understandable set of instructions or commands called machine language. A complete set of known commands is called an instruction list, sometimes abbreviated as IL. The languages created and used by humans and still evolving and changing and it is called natural languages. 
Each language consists of the following elements:- 
1. ALPHABET:- A set of symbols used to built a certain language.
2. LEXIS:- A set of words the language offers its users.
3. SYNTAX:- A set of rules used to determine if a string of words forms a valid sentence.
4. SEMANTICS:- A set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense.

MACHINE LANGUAGE vs HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE:-
High-level languages are languages that are atleast somewhat similar to natural ones which uses symbols, words and conventions readable to humans. A program written in high-level language is called source code and file which contains it is called source file.

COMPILATION vs INTERPRETATION:-

- Inorder to open terminal in VS CODE click CTRL+` (The one under ESC key).
- To run a python file in windows click, python3 filename.py.
- LINTING:- Analyzing our code for potential errors. Popular linter is pylint. 
- FORMATTING:- autopep8 extension can be installed. You can enable formatOnSave option for formatting the whole code on save.
- IMPLEMENTATIONS in python:- 
 1. Jython (Java)
 2. pypy (Subset of python)
 3. IronPython (C#)
 4. CPython (C)
- Boolean values in python should always start with capital letters True or False.
- A ll functions in Python return None when no value is specified.

STRING:-
- In slicing [0:3] means it will include 0,1,2 and only : will give the whole word.
- For printing double quotes alongwith the string, we can make use of the escape character called \. For eg:-
 course = "Python \"Programming"
 print(course)
OUTPUT = Python "Programming

ESCAPE CHARACTERS:-
# COMMENTS
\" For printing double quotes too
\' For printing single quote too
\\ For printing a single slash 
\n Newline

FORMATTED STRINGS:- Almost like concatenation. It is just like an expression that is evaluated at runtime. In this we can put any expression but between the curly braces.
first = "AYSHATH"
last = "IRFANA"
full = f"{first} {last}"
print(full)
OUTPUT = AYSHATH IRFANA

FUNCTIONS IN STRINGS:-
- len()  upper()  lower()  
- title() will capitalize every first letter.
- find() will give the last letter index of the given word from the value.
- rstrip() will clear the white space from the sentence.
- replace("p","j") will replace all p's with j's.
- print("value" in var_name) will return boolean value like true if the value is present in the variable.
- ord("b") will give the ASCII value of b 98.
NUMBERS:-
- Complex numbers like a+bi in python are represented as a+bj.
- Whole numbers.
- Decimal numbers.
- 10/3 will give decimal numbers and 10//3 will give integer numbers.
 + - * / // % **
FUNCTIONS:-
round() abs() 
For number related functions we can import a math module available in Python. It is an object and we can call and use the available functions in them.
import math
math.ceil()
TYPE CONVERSION:- type()

COMPARISON OPERATORS:- >< <= > >= == !=
CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS:-
if(condition):
elif(condition):
else:
TERNARY OPERATOR:-
age = 12
message = "Eligible" if age>=18 else "Not eligible"
print(message)
LOGICAL OPERATORS:- and or not 
LOOPS:-
for i in range(3):
 statements

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:-
It is a word used to refer to the system as a whole. AI is a way of giving machines to opearte in an intelligent way i.e the appropriate way it is to be opearted. We cannot say it mimicks human behaviour or intelligence, it has its own intelligence like human intelligence. AI is often powered by a model that enables this intelligence. For example think of ChatGPT it is an large example of AI and it is powered by a large language model(LLM). People working in big tech companies with AI may refer to it as using deep learning models to perform specific tasks that extract useful patterns and information to be used for prediction. Examples are self-drining cars, chatbots, voice assistants.
MACHINE LEARNING:-It is a part of AI that uses algos trained on data to produce models to perform tasks.
DEEP LEARNING:-It is a subset of ML that uses advanced models built using neural networks to perform taks in the world of ML.

MACHINE LEARNING:-
ML models powers AI. ML algos are those which learns from data. Some examples are linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vectors. They alone cannot do anything they learn patterns from the data which they are feeded into and predict outcomes from the unseen data. One example is house price prediction.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:-
It is a word used to refer to the system as a whole. AI is a way of giving machines to opearte in an intelligent way i.e the appropriate way it is to be opearted. We cannot say it mimicks human behaviour or intelligence, it has its own intelligence like human intelligence. AI is often powered by a model that enables this intelligence. For example think of ChatGPT it is an large example of AI and it is powered by a large language model(LLM). People working in big tech companies with AI may refer to it as using deep learning models to perform specific tasks that extract useful patterns and information to be used for prediction. Examples are self-drining cars, chatbots, voice assistants.
MACHINE LEARNING:-It is a part of AI that uses algos trained on data to produce models to perform tasks.
DEEP LEARNING:-It is a subset of ML that uses advanced models built using neural networks to perform taks in the world of ML.

MACHINE LEARNING:-
ML models powers AI. ML algos are those which learns from data. Some examples are linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vectors. They alone cannot do anything they learn patterns from the data which they are feeded into and predict outcomes from the unseen data. One example is house price prediction.
BUILDING A ML MODEL:-
1.Choose a ML algo.(SVM,LR,DT).
2.Feed training data to allow it to learn patterns.
3.Correct the algo iteratively inoder to improve its learning.
4.Here you have the model and validate it on testing the model.
At first we choose an ML algo and thentrain the data inorder to learn and update the parameters. Once the model is trained then it can be evaluated if it is usable. Then we can deploy the model and predict based on the unseen data. Models needs to retrained and redeployed as the data changes in the day to day life rapidly and it is usable only if it is updated according to the latest info available in the real world.
      Features or x variables are the ones that are fed in through the training data. The prediction that the model is making that is spam/ham,yes/no are called label,target or y variables.
 ML models are referred to as garbage in and garbage out. The ML models are best based on the quality of data used to train the model, if you train the model using low quality data whatever algo is used the model will perform poorly.
The types of ML models:-
1.CLASSIFICATION:-Used to predict categorical values, has discrete output.
2.REGRESSION:-Used to predict numerical or continous values, has a range of values or not discrete output.
3.CLUSTERING:-Used to find logical groups in data, aloows us to see different groups of data.
HISTORY OF ML:-
We talk about machine learning a lot asa technology that has gained steam in the last ten years,but machine learning has existed since the 1940s.It was in 1943 that the first neural network usingan electric circuit was developed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts.The goal of the problem was to try and solve communication between computers.So how could computers communicate with one another?In 1950, Alan Turing proposed something that's known as the Turing Test.This is a test of artificial intelligence that involves figuring out whethera machine can act like a human,or if humans can't tell the difference between a human and machine,given answers to questions.Humans pose questions to machines and receive answers,and they try to figure out whether it's a machine answering themor a human being.Doesn't matter if the answers are true or false,the idea is to figure out whether humans can tell the difference.In 1952, Arthur Samuel, who's considered a pioneer in machine learning,is credited with creating the first computer programto play championship-level checkers.In 1957, Frank Rosenblatt, who was a psychologist, developed the Perceptron.This can be thought of as the first neural network unit and algorithm,and you can trace a direct line from the neural networks of todayto the perceptron, first created in 1957.The goal of the perceptron was to learn from data by adjusting its parameters until it reached an optimal solution.
Back in the 50s there were symbolic andasymbolic systems.
